    <h2>Technical challenges</h2>
    <p>The main techincal challenge we face is getting use to the swift language. We are hoping that using the basics we learn in class and some additional research we will be able to create a product that we're happy with. </p>
    <h2>Scheduling challenges</h2>
    <p> Scheduling was not an issue we have brought up yet. We plan to discuss about it later in class.</p>
    <h2>Interpersonal challenges</h2>
    <p>We faced no interpersonal challenges this week. All we did was introduce ourselves and discuss what role we would each prefer to begin the project with.</p>
    <h2>Software Development Engineer</h2>
    <p>A Software Development Engineer is a developer who is responsible for designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. They use programming languages and technologies to create functional software systems, and may be involved in all aspects of the software development process, from gathering requirements and writing code, to testing and debugging software. Software Development Engineers typically work on a team of developers and may have expertise in a particular area of software development. I feel like I would be a good fit for this role becuase i have some previous coding experience.</p>
    <h2>QA Manager</h2>
    <p>A QA Manager is responsible for overseeing the quality assurance process for a software development project. This includes developing and implementing testing processes, as well as managing a team of QA testers. The QA Manager ensures that the software being developed meets the necessary quality standards, and works closely with the development team to identify and resolve any issues. In addition to managing the QA process, the QA Manager may also be responsible for reporting on the status of quality efforts to stakeholders. This role would be a good fit for me becuase I know how to test edge cases that are sometimes forgotted when the code was written.</p>
    <h2>Project Manager</h2>
    <p>A Project Manager is responsible for planning, organizing, and managing resources in order to successfully deliver a project within a set timeframe and budget. They may be responsible for communicating with stakeholders, coordinating with team members, and tracking progress to ensure that the project stays on track. Project Managers may also be responsible for identifying and mitigating risks, as well as developing contingency plans. This role would not be the best for me becuase I don't have the best time management, but I am ready to perform when the time comes.</p>
    <h2>Product Manager</h2>
    <p>A Product Manager is responsible for defining and prioritizing features for a product, and working with the development team to build and launch the product. They conduct market research, analyze customer feedback, and define the overall vision and strategy for the product. Product Managers play a key role in the development and success of a product, as they help guide the direction and priorities of the product team. They may also be responsible for developing and managing the product roadmap, as well as measuring and analyzing the performance of the product in the market. Although I am not too creative, I have good ideas about ncie quality of life features that can enhance ideas and build upon what we have already done previously.</p>
